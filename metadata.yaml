description: Mary Roberts Rinehart (August 12, 1876-September 22, 1958) was an American
  writer, often called the American Agatha Christie. She is considered the source
  of the phrase "The butler did it", although she did not actually use the phrase.
  She is considered to have invented the "Had-I-But-Known" school of mystery writing.
  She also created a costumed supercriminal called "the Bat," who was cited by Bob
  Kane as one of the inspirations for his "Batman."--Excerpted from Wikipedia, the
  free encyclopedia.
